Take a standard Mapbox map and Mapbox GL JS and then:

1. Make the map look as much as Apple map as you can (example below, try to match look & feel and visible POI layers of the Apple map, within 1-2 hours of time, using mapbox studio and/or other tools)

2. Implement search control using Mapbox places api

3. When the user clicks a POI on the map, show related information in a popup from foursquare or wikipedia APIs (depending if it has foursquare or wikidata id in mapbox data)

4. Implement routing using Mapbox routing API.

Bonus) Implement graphhopper.com routing API as an alternative route (if routes differ, make graph hopper route in green color).
